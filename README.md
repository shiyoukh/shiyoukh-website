# Shiyoukh

A minimal, animated personal website built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🧠 Concept
The website starts with an animated **"shiyoukh"** splash — a bold gradient text that captures attention.  
After two seconds, it elegantly transitions into a smaller animated logo in the top corner, revealing an about section with smooth scroll and motion effects.

This design balances aesthetics with performance — no frameworks, no dependencies, just clean, scalable code.

## ✨ Features
- **Animated Intro**: Brand title appears center-screen, then docks smoothly into the header.
- **Responsive Design**: Scales perfectly across devices using modern CSS.
- **Gradient Animation**: Dynamic linear gradient runs through the text for a futuristic look.
- **About Section**: Includes links to LinkedIn and GitHub.
- **Accessible Design**: Includes skip navigation, reduced motion support, and keyboard accessibility.

## 🛠️ Built With
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3 (Custom Properties, Animations, Flexbox, Grid)**
- **Vanilla JavaScript (for transitions and timing)**

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. On page load, the site waits ~2 seconds (or until the user interacts).
2. The logo animates up and shrinks into position.
3. The about section scrolls smoothly into view.
4. The "About" button in the corner triggers an overlay sheet with more info.

## 📁 File Structure
```
index.html    # Main website file
README.md     # This documentation file
assets/       # (optional) Future static assets (e.g., icons, fonts)
```
## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Add project cards with live demos.
- Integrate GitHub API to fetch repositories.
- Implement a custom SVG logo transition.
